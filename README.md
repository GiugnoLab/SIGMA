# SIGMA
> A Set-cover-based Inexact Graph Matching Algorithm 

### Description:
SIGMA is an indexing system for inexact graph matching.Given a query graph and fixed a maximum number of edge misses, SIGMA looks for all the inexact matches of the query in the database of target graphs. After a preprocessing phase, SIGMA executes the query phase by efficiently mining the database of target graphs to verify if there are matches. It outputs the set of matching graphs, the number of edges misses and other performance statistics.
